<u>so, where was the logic that we couldn't be faced with us?</u>
then, we met. we would become a heavier planet.
<u>Isn't it a romantic science that we've been able to have this relationship in this wide world?</u></p>

  <h1>WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS WE CAN DO?</h1>
  we can do business without less capital stock(money)
  the advantage of IT business is<ol>
      <li>we don't need a lot of money than others</li>
      <li>   can  gather a community easier</li>
      <li>   won't be pressed for rent (the rent building of money ins't necessary for a start!)
      <li>we don't have to be pressed for time.
          our business is not a bomb. we can do it after we work for other eterprises or get learn more experiences at any place and even we can do it in a company!
          most of famous CEO  did not carry their plans out directly after they planned it
</p>
  the first we've to do is that do your business along with work.
  the second is don't practice for a business. do your business for practice! it will drive us destination more faster
  ,also this web pages are it

  <p><h>The current type of IT business is <strong>Community business</strong></h>
  like '<a href="https://www.yanolja.com/?NaPm=ct%3Dkd5ooj20%7Cci%3Dcheckout%7Ctr%3Dds%7Ctrx%3D%7Chk%3De14ee0aba80b7d78775c8a5be3b39a5b7a018616" title="current type business">yanolja</a>, <a href="https://www.musinsa.com/" title="current type business">musinsa</a> 등'
